- JET OFF app state lives in `src/lib/store.tsx` (browser localStorage) and listings/templates in `src/lib/data.ts`; why: imported prototype, kept as-is until a server-backed data layer replaces it.
- Shared page chrome (header, nav, Card/Btn/Notice, `meta()`) lives in `src/components/Shell.tsx`; why: every route reuses it, so navigation changes happen in one place.
- Welcome and app pages reuse the same navigation drawer; sidebar presentation state is held by the root NavigationProvider without browser storage, so collapse survives route changes without changing app data.
